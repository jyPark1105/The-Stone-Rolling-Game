# The-Stone-Rolling-Game
Create a Sisyphus-like stone rolling game by adding Bullets, Animation, etc.

Overview: A real-time 3D game simulating the game of Sisyphus. Developed using OpenGL 4.3 and Bullet Physics, this project focuses on realistic rendering, skeletal animation, and interactive physics, inspired by the metaphor of eternal struggle represented through a rock-pushing mechanic.
